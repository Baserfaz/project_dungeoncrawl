# project_dungeoncrawl
A "game" made with java, based on custom 2D engine, build from ground up.

## Introduction to the game idea
The game world consists of tiles, which then creates a dungeon. In the dungeon there are enemies, traps and loot. 
The player chooses one class that has it's own unique spells and skills. The game uses old fashioned movement and attack system,
e.g. eye of the beholder. Equipment and inventory uses drag and drop system, where the player can drag the item from the game to
wanted slot. Also because this game takes influence from old style dungeon crawlers, the items have to be identified.

## Main ideas
* Random dungeons
* mouse GUI: movement, attack, drag & drop items
* "gimmicky" classes
* item identification
* item based gameplay: equipping/unequipping/looting/throwing/using etc. 

## Player classes
The classes are for now: 
* Defender (tank): shield tank, who can reflect blocked damage back to enemy
* Illusionist (item manipulator): can create items from thin air and also can make temporal copies of items
* Monk (support, healer): aoe-buffs that 
* Enchanter(support, buffer): can apply on attack/on hit proc effects on equipment
* Titan(melee fighter): massive single target dmg, has cleave chance, applies bleed effect and can create armor.
